input = word entered
size = length of word entered
end = size - 1
beginning = 0
input = [0,0,0,0,0,....]

for beginning <= end 
	print out the reversed word 
or else
	switch beginning and end
		beginning[] becomes placeholder 
		beginning[] becomes end []
		end[] becomes 	placeholder 
	beginning ++
		now beginning is [end] which is a
	end --
		now end is [beginning]
	revWord()

do you want to continue? y/n

	if yes, restart main
	if not, exit
	
example: darlene 
size = 7
end = [7-1 = 6]
beginning = [0]
	(will add one to beginning and subtract one from end until they are equal or for an even word beginning will be higher than end.)
